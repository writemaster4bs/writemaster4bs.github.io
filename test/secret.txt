Last week, I noticed a bug in the code, in the scoring
It was fine, but a clear sign that it needs fixing
I planned my day with some leeway to add some code
That plan nosedived when I opened my laptop

Tell me why, he moved everything around
In the code the stuff I write
It is nowhere to be found, anymore
It breaks my flow!
Did he do this to confuse me
'Cause how does he not know
How to organize his functions, by now?

I spent a while in this place
Scrolled a while in this maze
Every line took me a while
Parsing syntax at new places
Once so familiar, now so strange,
Would it kill ya, not to change?
Where the functions and the timers,
It's a crisis!

Tell me why, he moved everything around
In the code the stuff I write
It is nowhere to be found, anymore
It breaks my flow!
Did he do this to confuse me
'Cause how does he not know
How to organize his functions, by now?
